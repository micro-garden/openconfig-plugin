# Open Config Plugin for Micro

**Open Config** is a plugin for the
[micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/) text editor that makes it easy to
open and work with configuration files located in micro's config directory,
such as `settings.json`, `bindings.json`, and `init.lua`.

See [help/openconfig.md](help/openconfig.md) for more details.

## Installation

Place the plugin folder in `~/.config/micro/plug/openconfig/`, or clone it
directly from the GitHub repository:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/micro/plug
git clone https://github.com/micro-garden/openconfig-plugin ~/.config/micro/plug/openconfig
```

Alternatively, this plugin is also available through the unofficial plugin
channel:  
https://github.com/micro-garden/unofficial-plugin-channel  
You can install it by adding the channel and then using `plugin install`.
